# Machine Learning Report: Child Mind Institute - Problematic Internet Use
This project involves solving the **Child Mind Institute - Problematic Internet Use** problem using machine learning models. Various approaches such as **XGBoost**, **CatBoost**, and **LightGBM** are employed alongside an ensemble method (**Voting Regressor**) to predict the target variable. The dataset includes **time-series features**, which are preprocessed, followed by model training, evaluation, and submission creation.

## How to Use

### Running the Project on Kaggle
1. Upload the `notebooks/final_model.ipynb` file to Kaggle.
2. Use the Child Mind Institute - Problematic Internet Use dataset for both training and testing. Ensure the dataset is properly loaded as per the instructions in the notebook.
3. Run all cells in `final_model.ipynb` to generate predictions.
4. The output of the notebook will be a `submission.csv` file. Submit this file directly to Kaggle.

### Notes on Evaluation
- The `outputs/evaluation_results.csv` file contains the results of all model versions and iterations. Use this to review past performances and insights for improving the model further.
- For detailed explanations of preprocessing or model settings, refer to the respective configuration files (`model_config.yaml`, `preprocess_config.yaml`).
